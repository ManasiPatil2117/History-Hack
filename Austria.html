        One of Vienna's most important cultural landmarks is this lovely Gothic Cathedral. Your attention are drawn to this majestic building by the multicoloured decorative tiles on the rooftop that are placed to form the imperial double-headed eagle. There are four towers, 13 bells, and a stunning, opulent interior.

        This extremely beautiful royal building, a remnant of the exhaustively dominating Austrian dynasty known as the House of Habsburg, was initially constructed in the 13th century and has since undergone considerable renovations. Its former use as the offices of many of the nation's most significant political personalities, including emperors and dukes, has left witnesses to a colourful and exciting past.

        Vienna's City Hall, which houses the city's mayor, is a magnificent neo-Gothic limestone structure located in the Innere Stadt neighbourhood and across from Rathauspark. The design was created by architect Friedrich von Schmidt, who started work on the project in 1872. It has five towers and a surface area of more than 19,000 square metres.
