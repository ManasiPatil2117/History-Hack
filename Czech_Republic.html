      In the heart of Prague, Wenceslas Square (Vaclavske Namesti) is a
      bustling commercial area. It was first used as a horse market in the
      14th century under King Charles IV. In the 19th century, it was formally
      renamed Wenceslas Square in honour of Saint Wenceslas, the patron saint
      of Bohemia. The statue of Saint Wenceslas riding a horse was placed in
      the square at this period. Political and social meetings have taken
      place in Wenceslas Square, including the reading of the Czechoslovak
      Proclamation of Independence on October 28, 1918. Jan Palach, a student
      from the Czech Republic, lit himself on fire in Wenceslas Square on
      January 16, 1969, to protest the Soviet Union's occupation of
      Czechoslovakia.

      The largest castle complex in the world and the most recognisable sight
      in the Czech Republic is Prague Castle (Prazsky hrad), which is also a
      UNESCO World Heritage site. The complex, which spans 70,000 square
      metres, includes the St. Vitus Cathedral, Lobkowicz Palace, and St.
      George's Basilica in addition to a number of additional palaces,
      observation towers, museums, and art galleries. Prince Boivoj of the
      Premyslid Dynasty first began construction on Prague Castle in or around
      the year 880 AD. Since then, it has served as the residence of Czech
      kings, religious authorities, Holy Roman emperors, and chiefs of state.

      The Battle of Austerlitz, commonly referred to as the Battle of the
      Three Emperors, took place at Austerlitz Battlefield on December 2,
      1805. The Russian and Austrian empires' combined troops were soundly
      defeated by Napoleon Bonaparte's army. Russia withdrew to its own
      territory as a result of the Battle of Austerlitz, and Austria was
      compelled to accept the Treaty of Pressburg. The Cairn of Peace, a
      battle memorial, now stands as the main feature of Austerlitz
      Battlefield. The Zuran, Pratzen Heights, and Santon hills nearby offer
      the greatest views. The military campaign is explained on plaques and
      information boards. Visitors to the Austerlitz Battlefield can enjoy
      multimedia exhibits and explore the adjacent church and museum at the
      Cairn of Peace.
