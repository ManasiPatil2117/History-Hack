      Unquestionably a popular tourist destination in Egypt, Giza, or "Al
      Giza," is home to some of Ancient Egypt's most well-known attractions,
      most notably the famed Pyramids of Giza. The pyramids of Pharaohs Khufu,
      Khafra, and Menkaure can be found inside the complex of pyramids. The
      world's largest pyramid, as well as the largest pyramid in Giza,
      belonged to Khufu or "Cheop," the second monarch of the Fourth Dynasty.

      An amazing collection of ancient Egyptian structures, including several
      rock temples, may be seen in the Egyptian archaeological site of Abu
      Simbel. The two Temples of Ramesses II are Abu Simbel's most well-known
      landmarks. One of the most well-known Egyptian pharaohs, Ramesses II,
      also known as Ramesses the Great or Ramses, was a member of the
      Nineteenth Dynasty.
