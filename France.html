      The fourth arrondissement of Paris, France, is home to the Gothic Notre Dame Cathedral, also known as Notre Dame
      de Paris (which translates to "Our Lady of Paris" in French). Its main entrance faces the west. The island is
      located on the Île de la Cité's eastern side.


      In contrast to earlier Romanesque design, the Notre Dame Cathedral exhibits a strong impact of naturalism in its
      sculptures and stained glass windows. Its construction took place during the Gothic era, making it one of the
      first Gothic churches.

      The Louvre Museum, also referred to as the Great Louvre, is the national museum of France. It is located on the
      right side of the Philip Augustus Fortress, which dates back to the 12th century. It is one of the most popular
      museums in the world and has artefacts dating from early civilisation until the middle of the 19th century.

      On the banks of the Seine river in Paris, the magnificent palace and museum are built in the baroque style. It is
      one of the most popular tourist destinations in both France and all of Europe. Egyptian antiquities, Greek and
      Roman sculptures, crown jewels, old master paintings, and artefacts from French nobility are just a few examples
      of the diverse items in the Louvre's collection.

      The Latin Quarter is a richly cultural and geographically diverse region in Paris's charming 5th and 6th
      arrondissements. It surrounds the University of Paris, often known as the Sorbonne, roughly on its left bank of
      the Seine River.

      The Latin Quarter is well-known as a hub for education throughout the globe. Along with the venerable University
      of Paris, the neighbourhood is home to the École Normale Supérieure, the École des Mines de Paris, and
      Panthéon-Assas University.
