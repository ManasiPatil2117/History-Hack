      The Brandenburg Gate, a well-known monument in Berlin constructed between 1788 and 1791, was formerly the city's
      entrance. The sculpture was placed at the entrance to the street Unter den Linden, which led to the city palace,
      and was commissioned by King Frederick William II of Prussia.

      On December 22, 1989, during the unification of East and West Berlin, the gate was once again opened as West
      German Chancellor Helmut Kohl entered it to meet East German Prime Minister Hans Modrow. The Brandenburg Gate was
      elevated to a national emblem once the Berlin Wall fell.

      One of Berlin's most important historical structures is the Reichstag, which has silently witnessed the violent
      history of both Berlin and all of Germany. The German parliament currently resides there as well.

      The Reichstag, built by architect Paul Wallot under Emperor Wilhelm I, included various ground-breaking structural
      features, including the first-ever steel and glass copula.

      It took more than 600 years to build the enormous and spectacular Cologne Cathedral (KÃ¶lner Dom). It is the
      second-highest skyscraper in Cologne and is visible from almost everywhere in the city.

      The current Cologne Cathedral was built on the site of three gradually larger churches and a Roman villa estimated
      to have been built in the 4th century. Construction on the current cathedral started in 1248.
