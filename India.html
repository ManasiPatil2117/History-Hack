      One of the seven wonders of the world, the Taj Mahal is also the most visited tourist destination in the nation.
      Shah Jahan, the Mughal emperor, constructed the Taj as a sign of love for his wife Mumtaz. The Taj was a "teardrop
      on the cheek of eternity," according to Tagore. The memorial draws numerous visitors throughout the entire year.

      This minaret, the tallest individual tower in the world at 234 feet, is the epitome of Mughal architectural
      genius.
      The largest individual tower in the world and the second tallest landmark in Delhi, Qutub Minar is a tower that
      attracts tourists despite being repeatedly devastated by the ravages of natural catastrophes. It is a
      Mehrauli-based UNESCO World Heritage Site that Qutb Ud-Din-Aibak, the creator of the Delhi Sultanate, began to
      build in 1192. Over the centuries, the tower was afterwards constructed by numerous kings. This magnificent
      structure transports you back to India's colourful past.

      The most well-known structure in Jaipur is the Hawa Mahal, also known as the Palace of Winds, which was
      constructed in 1799 by Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh using pink sandstone. This unusual five-story building, known
      as a jharokha, combines Islamic and Hindu architectural styles. It includes small latticed windows. It presently
      houses a well-designed museum, but it was originally built for the royal women to observe and enjoy the
      processions and other activities on the street below.
