      The Leaning Tower of Pisa, also known as Torre Pendente di Pisa in Italian, is a UNESCO World Heritage site and
      one of the Historical Places in Italy that you must visit. This is the third-oldest landmark in the mediaeval town
      of Pisa, which is well-known for the settlement of its foundation. The tower's tilt was not intentionally planned
      when it was built, somewhere between the 12th and the 13th century.

      Due of the weak ground, however, it began to tilt as building got underway. You will be in awe when you pass by a
      monument that is 50 metres tall and leans outward by 5.5 degrees, or roughly 15 feet (4.5 metres).

    <p>
      Herculaneum, also known as Ercolano in Italy, is another one of the historical sites there that you can see. The
      ancient Roman settlement of Herculaneum is located outside of Naples. Visit this town that was given the name
      Hercules in honour of the Greek deity Herakles and is thought to have existed in the sixth century BC.

      Discover the ruins of one of Italy's historical sites, which were buried under volcanic ash and lava after Mount
      Vesuvius' eruption in 79 AD and largely preserved over time.

    <h3 class="text-center fw-bold">Area Sacra di Largo Argentina</h3>

      The Sacred Area of Largo di Torre, also known as Area Sacra di Largo Argentina, is one of the Historical Places in
      Italy. It is an old plaza featuring the ruins of Pompey's Theatre, where Julius Caesar was assassinated, and four
      temples of the Roman Republic.

      Given that so many cats have settled down at this excavation site, the area is also known as the "city of cats."
      This location, one of the historical sites in Italy, must be seen, especially at night. The golden lights that are
      placed around the ruins at night give them a lovely appearance.
