      The largest adobe city in the world and the largest pre-Colombian
      metropolis in the Americas, Chan Chan is an outstanding sight in Peru.
      The ancient Chimu civilization's capital, Chan Chan, began to take shape
      around 1300 AD and would have reached its apex in the 15th century, when
      the Chimu were conquered by the Incas and the city was left in ruins.
      The Chimu were incredibly skilled architects and engineers.

      The Macchu Picchu of the North, Kuélap is a massive 9th-century castle
      that was originally the bastion of the Chachapoyas people, a group that
      inhabited the area until just before the Spanish invasion. Kuélap, which
      rises 3,000 metres above sea level, is a striking location with
      limestone walls enclosing a community of about 450 stone homes. Up to
      3,000 people previously called it home, and many of the buildings still
      have their thatched roofs and ornate carvings.

      A little-known Incan city in the south of Peru called Choquequirao may
      have been the last bastion of the Incan civilization. Due to its remote
      location and similar style to the much more well-known Machu Picchu,
      Choquequirao is virtually entirely uninhabited by tourists, which makes
      it much more atmospheric and deserving of the effort required to reach
      it.
