      According to Arab geographer Muhammad al-Idrisi, who lived around 1140, the Roman Bridge of Cordoba, Spain, which
      was constructed by the Romans in the first century BC, "surpasses all other bridges in beauty and solidity."

      The bridge played a significant role in the 1350s wars between the city of Cordoba and many opponents, including
      the ominously called Peter the Cruel, in addition to being unquestionably a work of art.

      Calat Alhambra, often known as the "Red Fortress," is a magnificent collection of royal palaces, mosques, spas,
      shops, and other structures encircled by a commanding 2-kilometer fortification wall near Granada.

      The Alhambra is now accessible to the public. You can take a tour of its palaces, which include the Palacio
      Nazares and the Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, palace from the sixteenth century. Another notable feature of the
      Alhambra is its "citadel," or Alcazaba, which serves as the main defence for the entire complex.

      Christopher Columbus's final burial place is at Seville Cathedral, the third-largest cathedral in the world and a
      World Heritage site.

      Seville Cathedral is a grand gothic building that is only larger than St. Peter's in Rome and St. Paul's in
      London. It has a total space of 11,520 square metres. When comparing volume, some even contend that it is actually
      the biggest.
